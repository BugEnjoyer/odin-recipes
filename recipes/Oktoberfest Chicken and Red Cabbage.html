  <h1>Oktoberfest Chicken and Red Cabbage</h1>
  <img src="images/oktoberfest-chicken-and-red-cabbage.webp" class="img1">
  <h4>One of the most famous German dishes</h4>
  <p>I adore Bavarian cuisine! And since there's no good German food here (while I lived in San Francisco, my husband and I ate at wonderful German/Hungarian restaurants there), I have to make my own...This recipe is crazy simple.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 slices bacon</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon bacon drippings</li>
    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
    <li>2 pounds skinless chicken thighs</li>
    <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
    <li>1 large apple, cored and sliced</li>
    <li>1 head red cabbage, cored and sliced</li>
    <li>½ cup red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>¼ cup dry red wine</li>
    <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon (Optional)</li>
    
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place bacon in a large oven-safe or cast-iron skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels. When cool, crumble bacon; leave bacon drippings in the skillet.</li>
    <li>Whisk flour, kosher salt, and smoked paprika together in a bowl. Coat chicken thighs in the seasoned flour and brown on both sides in the hot bacon fat over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side; transfer chicken to a plate. Drain bacon grease except for 1 tablespoon; cook and stir onion and apple until onion is translucent and apple is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir red cabbage and bacon into onion-apple mixture, sprinkle with a pinch of kosher salt, and cook, stirring often, until cabbage is softened, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour red wine vinegar and red wine into skillet. Stir in brown sugar and cinnamon and bring cabbage mixture to a boil; cook until sauce is reduced by half, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Arrange chicken thighs on top of cabbage in the skillet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cabbage is tender and chicken is cooked through, about 40 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
